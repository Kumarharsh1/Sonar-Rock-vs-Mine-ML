Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify sonar signals as either rock or mine. Using models like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we preprocess sonar data, extract features, and optimize models for better accuracy. The repository contains Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and datasets used in training and evaluation.
Installation Guide
